About the backend/port

This is the readme for the official GP2X ScummVM backend (also known as
the GP2X port).

This is an SVN test release of ScummVM for the GP2X, it would be
appreciated if this SVN test distribution was not mirrored and that
people be directed to http://scummvm.distant-earth.com/ instead for
updated SVN builds.

Full supported official releases of the GP2X ScummVM backend are made in
line with main official releases and are avalalble from the ScummVM
downloads page <http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supported audio options

Raw audio.
MP3 audio.
OGG Vorbis audio.

FLAC audio is currently unsupported.

For best results use uncompressed audio in games.
