The files in this direcory are a bit outdated. There are some small non
critical errors in "patch.001", they are obvious if you bother to read
the source (which is correct). "sound01.txt" is just meant to give you a
basic understanding of the structures invovled in
SCI01/SCI1/SCI1.1/SCI32 sound resources.

Ravi has made some really good documentation for SCI0.
