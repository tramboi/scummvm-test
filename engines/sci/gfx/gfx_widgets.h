/* Terminology
**
** Two special terms are used in here: /equivalent/ and /clear/. Their meanings
** in this context are as follows:
**
** /clear/: Clearing a widget means overwriting the space it occupies in the back
** buffer with data from the static buffer. This affects both the visual and the
** priority buffer, the static buffer (and any effect the widget may have had on
** it) is not touched.
**
** /equivalent/: Two Widgets A and B are equivalent if and only if either of the
** following conditions is met:
** a) Both A and B are text widgets, and they occupy the same bounding rectangle.
** b) Both A and B are dynview widgets, and they have the same unique ID
** Note that /equivalent/ is not really an equivalence relation- while it is ob-
** viously transitive and symmetrical, it is not reflexive (e.g. a box widget
** is not /equivalent/ to itself), although this might be a nice addition for the
** future.

/* Widget operations */
/*********************/

/* These are for documentation purposes only. The actual declarations are in
** gfx_state_internal.h.
**
**
**
** -- draw(GfxWidget *self, Common::Point pos)
** Draws the widget.
** Parameters: (GfxWidget *) self: self reference
**             (Common::Point) pos: The position to draw to (added to the widget's
**                            internal position)
** Returns   : (int) 0
** The widget is drawn iff it is flagged as dirty. Invoking this operation on
** a container widget will recursively draw all of its contents.
**
**
** -- tag(GfxWidget *self)
** Tags the specified widget
** Parameters: (GfxWidget *) self: self reference
** Returns   : (int) 0
** If invoked on a container widget, this will also tag all of the container's
** contents (but not the contents' contents!)
**
**
** -- print(GfxWidget *self, int indentation)
** Prints a string representation of the widget with sciprintf
** Parameters: (GfxWidget *) self: self reference
**             (int) indentation: Number of double spaces to indent
** Returns   ; (int) 0
** Will recursively print all of the widget's contents if the widget contains
** further sub-widgets
**
**
** -- compare_to(GfxWidget *self, GfxWidget *other)
** Compares two compareable widgets by their screen position
** Parameters: (GfxWidget *) self: self reference
**             (GfxWidget *) other: other widget
** Returns   : (int) <0, 0, or >0 if other is, respectively, less than, equal
**                   to, or greater than self
** This comparison only applies to some widgets; compare_to(a,a)=0 is not
** guaranteed. It may be used for sorting for all widgets.
**
**
** -- equals(GfxWidget *self, GfxWidget *other)
** Compares two compareable widgets for equality
** Parameters: (GfxWidget *) self: self reference
**             (GfxWidget *) other: other widget
** Returns   : (int) 0 if the widgets are not equal, != 0 if they match
** This operation checks whether two widgets describe the same graphical data.
** It is used to determine whether a new widget should be discarded because it
** describes the same graphical data as an old widget that has already been
** drawn. For lists, it also checks whether all contents are in an identical
** order.
**
**
** -- should_replace(GfxWidget *self, GfxWidget *other)
** Compares two compareable widgets for equality
** Parameters: (GfxWidget *) self: self reference
**             (GfxWidget *) other: other widget
** Returns   : (int) 0 if 'self' should be kept, != 0 if it should be replaced
**             by the 'other'
** When 'equals' returns true, this means that no new widget will be added.
** However, in some cases newer widgets may contain information that should
** cause the older widget to be removed nonetheless; this is indicated by this
** function.
**
**
** -- superarea_of(GfxWidget *self, GfxWidget *other)
** Tests whether drawing self after other would reduce all traces of other
** Parameters: (GfxWidget *) self: self reference
**             (gxfw_widget_t *) other: The widget to compare for containment
** Returns   : (int) 1 if self is superarea_of other, 0 otherwise
**
**
**
** **************************
** ** Container operations **
** **************************
**
**
** -- free_tagged(GfxContainer *self)
** Frees all tagged resources in the container
** Parameters: (GfxContainer *) self: self reference
** Returns   : (int) 0
** The container itself is never freed in this way.
**
**
** -- free_contents(GfxContainer *self)
** Frees all resources contained in the container
** Parameters: (GfxContainer *) self: self reference
** Returns   : (int) 0
**
**
** -- add_dirty_abs(GfxContainer *self, rect_t dirty, int propagate)
** Adds a dirty rectangle to the container's list of dirty rects
** Parameters: (GfxContainer *) self: self reference
**             (rect_t) dirty: The rectangular screen area that is to be flagged
**                             as dirty, absolute to the screen
**             (int) propagate: Whether the dirty rect should be propagated to the
**                              widget's parents
** Returns   : (int) 0
** Transparent containers will usually pass this value to their next ancestor,
** because areas below them might have to be redrawn.
** The dirty rectangle management strategy is defined in this file in
** GFXW_DIRTY_STRATEGY.
**
**
** -- add_dirty_rel(GfxContainer *self, rect_t dirty, int propagate)
** Adds a dirty rectangle to the container's list of dirty rects
** Parameters: (GfxContainer *) self: self reference
**             (rect_t) dirty: The rectangular screen area that is to be flagged
**                             as dirty, relative to the widget
**             (int) propagate: Whether the dirty rect should be propagated to the
**                              widget's parents
** Returns   : (int) 0
** Transparent containers will usually pass this value to their next ancestor,
** because areas below them might have to be redrawn.
** The dirty rectangle management strategy is defined in this file in
** GFXW_DIRTY_STRATEGY.
**
**
** -- add(GfxContainer *self, GfxWidget *widget)
** Adds a widget to the list of contained widgets
** Parameters: (GfxContainer *) self: self reference
**             (GfxWidget *) widget: The widget to add
** Returns   : (int) 0
** Sorted lists sort their content into the list rather than adding it to the
** end.
