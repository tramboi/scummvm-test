DISPLAY SETUP

  "Graphics mode"
    There are 4 modes to choose from:
    1) Standard
    2) Standard antialiased
    3) Dual-strike
    4) Dual-strike antialiased

    Dual-strike modes render at half the vertical resolution. On interlaced
    modes this means that only one field is used for rendering, effectively
    using progressive frames (240p) with no "combing" effect. These modes
    improve the picture quality for low-res games, especially on CRTs.
    Not all display devices support these modes. Only available for games with
    a vertical resolution of 240 pixels or less.

    Antialiased modes soften the picture to some degree. This is a feature of
    the GPU (no game performance loss).

  "Aspect ratio correction"
    Some games run at a native resolution of 320x200 pixels using non-square
    pixels for a 4:3 display. This video mode is not available on the Wii or
    Gamecube, and this feature stretches the picture to 320x240 pixels to the
    original 4:3 aspect ratio.

  "Fullscreen mode"
    If your Wii is set to 16:9, this will stretch the picture to fullscreen.
    Turning this option off results in pillarboxing (black borders on the left
    and right sides), but the aspect ratio will be kept. This option has no
    effect on 4:3 displays.

  If the picture gets cropped or black bars are visible, use the Wii options
  dialog to adjust it. Pressing 1 on the Wiimote or R on the Gamecube pad
  opens this dialog. The available video options are specific to each of the
  graphics modes mentioned above. Settings will be saved for each.
