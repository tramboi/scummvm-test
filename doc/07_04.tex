\subsection{Playing sound with MIDI emulation}

Some games (such as Sam and Max) only contain MIDI music data.  This once
prevented music for these games from working on platforms that do not support
MIDI, or soundcards that do not provide MIDI drivers (e.g, many soundcards will
not play MIDI under Linux). ScummVM can now emulate MIDI mode using sampled
waves and Adlib, FluidSynth MIDI emulation or MT-32 emulation using the
-eadlib, -efluidsynth or -emt32 options respectively.  However, if you are
capable of using native MIDI, we recommend using one of the MIDI modes below
for best sound.
