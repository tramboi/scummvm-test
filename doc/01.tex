\section{About}

ScummVM is a collection of interpreters, capable of emulating several
adventure game engines. ScummVM mainly supports engines created using 
SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion), used in various
LucasArts games such as Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, and others.

ScummVM also contains interpreters for several non-SCUMM games. Currently
these are Beneath a Steel Sky, Broken Sword 1 \& 2, Flight of the Amazon Queen,
Gobliiins, Inherit the Earth, Simon the Sorcerer 1 \& 2.

At this time ScummVM should be considered beta software, and is still
under heavy development. Be aware that whilst we attempt to make sure
that many games can be completed with few major bugs, crashes can happen.

If you enjoy ScummVM feel free to donate using the PayPal button on the
ScummVM homepage. This will help us buy utilities needed to develop ScummVM
easier and quicker. If you cannot donate, help and contribute a patch!
