\subsection{Playing sound with MT-32 emulation}

Some games which contain MIDI music data also have improved tracks designed
for MT-32 sound module. ScummVM can now emulate this card, however you should
provide original MT-32 ROMs to make it work.

MT32\_PCM.ROM     - IC21 (512KB)
MT32\_CONTROL.ROM - IC26 (32KB) and IC27 (32KB), interleaved byte-wise

Place these ROMs in the game directory or a directory specified by extrapath.

You don't need to specify --native-mt32 with this driver, as it automatically
gets turned on.

\textbf{NOTE:} The processor requirements for the emulator are quite high; a fast CPU is
 strongly recommended.
