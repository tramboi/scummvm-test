\subsection{Commodore64 games notes}
Both Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken run but Maniac Mansion is not yet
playable. Either use extract\_mm\_c64 (but then game will not be autodetected)
or name D64 disks as "maniac1.d64", "maniac2.d64" and "zak1.d64", "zak2.d64"
respectively. If you add the game manually, make sure that platform is set to
Commodore64.
