\subsection{Inherit the Earth notes}
In order to run MacOS X wyrmkeep rerelease of the game you will need to copy
over data from the CD to hard drive. If you're on PC then consult

\url{http://www.scummvm.org/documentation.php?view=maccd-howto}

Although it talks about SCUMM games, it describes HFVExplorer utility. Note
that you will need to put speech data "Inherit the Earth Voices" in same
directory as game data which is stored in

\begin{verbatim}
  Inherit the Earth.app/Contents/Resources
\end{verbatim}

For old Mac OS9 release you will need to copy files in MacBinary format,
i.e. they should have both resource and data forks. Just copy all 'ITE *' files.
