\section{Music and Sound} \label{sect-music-and-sound}
By default, on most operating systems, ScummVM will automatically use Adlib
emulation. MIDI may not be available on all operating systems or may need
manual configuration. If you ARE using MIDI, you have several different
choices of output, depending on your operating system and configuration.

\begin{tabular}[h]{ll}
  null       & Null output. Don't play any music.\\
             & \\
  adlib      & Uses internal Adlib Emulation (default)\\
  fluidsynth & Uses FluidSynth MIDI Emulation\\
  mt32       & Uses internal MT-32 Emulation\\
  pcjr       & Uses internal PCjr Emulation \\
  pcspk      & Uses internal PC Speaker Emulation\\
  towns      & Uses FM-TOWNS YM2612 Emulation\\
             & \\
  alsa       & Output using ALSA sequencer device. See below.\\
  core       & CoreAudio sound, for Mac OS X users.\\
  coremidi   & CoreMIDI sound, for Mac OS X users. Use only if you have a hardware MIDI synthesizer.\\
  qt         & Quicktime sound, for Macintosh users.\\
  seq        & Uses /dev/sequencer for MIDI, *nix users. See below.\\
  windows    & Windows MIDI. Uses built-in sequencer, for Windows users\\
\end{tabular}

To select a sound driver, pass its name via the '-e' option to scummvm,
for example:
\begin{verbatim}
   scummvm -e adlib monkey2
\end{verbatim}
